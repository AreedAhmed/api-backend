## Contributing guidelines

- Depending on what your contribution is you might want to speak to the development team before doing anything. The guys are generally available on the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/reconmap/community) for the project.
- If you are contributing with code, make sure you have forked the project, and created a pull requests that contains amongst other things a description of your changes.
- Code changes need to adhere to our coding standard. This is [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
- Ideally you should add unit test coverage (with PHPUnit) to your changes, but this is not mandatory for certain changes.
